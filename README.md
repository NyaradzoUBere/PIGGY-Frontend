## Why Piggy?
I created this app because of my personal affinity for finance. Being a recent graduate of both finance and accounting, I constantly think about the way I am breaking out my daily, weekly, and monthly income. This app serves to be a beginners resource for those just now thinking about how finance plays into their lives and ways to imporve financial habits.
